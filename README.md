# My Portfolio Website

## Description 
I have created a website that hosts all of the projects I have built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. This was also a project in itself whose main purpose was to develop better responsive webpage design skills. This was the second project assignment for my Full-Stack Web Development Nanodegree through `Udacity.com`.  If you're interested in learning to code I highly suggest trying out one of the several different Nanodegree programs they offer. I've provide the links to their home page and Nanodegrees below.
